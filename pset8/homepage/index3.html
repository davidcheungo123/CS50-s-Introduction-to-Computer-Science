        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                The volunteer’s dilemma game models a classic situation that each player in the game can choose either to
                sacrifice himself for the public good or to wait for the others in the game to sacrifice themselves in order
                to reach the same target. Different from Samaritan’s Dilemma in which players’ actions may lead to the laziness
                of other players and involves concepts like asymmetric information, each player in volunteer’s dilemma does not
                know what action the others exactly take and wait in hope of benefiting from others’ efforts. For example, electricity
                supply of an independent house has failed, thus at least one family member must go to fix it or otherwise everyone in
                the house will suffer from the consequences.
